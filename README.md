# 🚀 LIBFT Project - 42 Bangkok

![Ecole 42 Banner](images-42.jpeg)

**A deep dive into core C library functions and memory management, reimagined under the 42 Bangkok curriculum.**  

---

## 🎯 Overview

This project showcases a custom “libc-like” library, **LIBFT**, built from the ground up. It replicates essential C standard library functions while introducing robust enhancements and memory optimizations.

---

## 🏆 Key Responsibilities

- **🔧 Re-implemented Core C Library Functions**  
  - Implemented `malloc`, `free`, `strlen`, `memcpy`, `strcpy`, etc.  
  - Gained deeper insights into **low-level programming** and **memory management**.

- **⚙️ Custom Memory Allocation**  
  - Designed specialized allocators to efficiently manage dynamic memory.  
  - Ensured **no memory leaks** or **buffer overflows** by employing best practices.

- **🔬 Rigorous Testing**  
  - Validated correctness, efficiency, and robustness across diverse edge cases.  
  - Created automated test suites to guarantee reliability and performance.

- **🔗 Reusable Library Development**  
  - Packaged all functions into a **highly modular, reusable** library.  
  - Accelerated future project development by leveraging this common code base.

- **⚡ Performance Optimization**  
  - Focused on **speed** and **memory usage**, streamlining hotspots.  
  - Leveraged profiling to address bottlenecks where relevant.

## 🌍 Why LIBFT Matters

1. **Deeper C Proficiency**: Understand the underpinnings of functions we take for granted (e.g., `malloc`, `free`).
2. **Enhanced Debugging Skills**: Diagnosing and troubleshooting memory issues fosters strong problem-solving.
3. **Reusable Utility**: A personal library that can be integrated in future 42 projects or standalone initiatives.
